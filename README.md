## Kotlin puzzlers and challenges

### Puzzlers topics:
- Kotlin language basics (TODO)
- Coroutines (WIP)

### Puzzlers structure

All topics have `_Tasks` file and `tasks`, `hints` and `solutions` folders.

* All tasks are explained in `_Tasks` file. And you should write your code there. Tasks are orders by its difficulty
* `hints` - Hits to the tasks.
* `solutions` - Complete solutions.
* `utils` - Classes, functions and data for the tasks.

To check your solution, find `_TasksTest` file in `test/koltin/<your_topic>` and run all tests in it.

You are welcome to add new tasks or suggest any changes. Just open an issue or open pull request.
